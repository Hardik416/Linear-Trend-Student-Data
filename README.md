# Linear-Trend-Student-Data
This project uses Linear Regression to predict student marks based on study hours. Built with Python, Scikit-Learn, and Pandas, it demonstrates a full ML pipeline: data splitting, model training, and MSE evaluation. It includes a Matplotlib visualization to show the correlation between time and performance. Ideal for a data science portfolio.
